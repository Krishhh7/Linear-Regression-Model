# Linear-Regression-Model
Simple Linear Regression using OLS in R to understand the relationship between years of experience and the salary.

  We first manually create a data set consisting of year of experience and the respective salary using data frame function.
  Check the summary of the data and plot a scatter plot with the two variables.
  We use a box-plot to check for any outliers in our data set.
  We then split the main data into training data (60%) and testing data (40%) to perform OLS.
  We perform Linear Regression on the training data and check the summary of the model.
